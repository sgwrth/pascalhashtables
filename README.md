# About
In this project, we are creating a custom implementation of hash tables in Pascal.  The Pascal dialect we will use is that described by the ISO 7185 standard of 1990 (from here on referred to as 'ISO Pascal.')  As a compiler, we will use fpc (Free Pascal compiler) with the '-Miso' flag, which will enforce the ISO 7185 standard.  Unlike other dialects, ISO Pascal does not have a hash table implementation of its own, but it comes with all the tools we need to implement one ourselves.  Obviously, this project is entirely educational, primarily as regards the basic structure and mechanisms of hash tables.

# Requirements
The following software will be required to build this project as intended:
- fpc (Free Pascal compiler)
- make
